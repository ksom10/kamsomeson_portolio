                <h1>Web Wizard's Whimsical Bio</h1>
                <p>I'm a Front-End Developer located in Pompano Beach, Florida. I graduated from IUPUI with a degree in Media Arts & Science, 
                    with certifications in Web Devlopment and Human-Computer Interaction.  </p>
                    <p>I have a serious passion for creating highly efficient mobile apps and websites. I love the challenge of learning new programming
                        languages and improving my toolbox of languages and libraries! I also have experience in marketing for SaaS products and take pride in
                        my ability to sell a worthwhile product.    </p>
                    <p>While interacting with computers is my specialty, I enjoy interacting with people just as much! During my time as an undergrad at IUPUI,
                        I was the Vice President and Co-founder of the Web Design & Development Association (WDDA). The WDDA allowed student developers a community
                        to work together and create amazing projects as well as network with other aspiring developers.
